# Matrix Multiplication - Peformance Analysis
Optmization analysis of a matrix dot product algorithm for a HPC(High Performance Computing) cluster node.
The current work contains incremental versions with different optimization techniques such as:
- memory locality via block optimization
- vectorization
- multicore processing
- offloading to a co-processor or GPU

The findings and techniques are described in a report aswell as the context in which the tests/benchmarks
were performed.
Project developed in a Masters in Computer Engineering at Universidade do Minho for the Advanced Architecures
